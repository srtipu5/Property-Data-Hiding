# Property-Data-Hiding
Setter and Getter Method used when we want to hide data from user.
we can set condition on setting data also using setter getter method and property.
On the other hand, using auto property we can not set contion on setting data but 
auto property is mostly use in application because of setting restriction on data 
we use data annotation and javascript or jquery form validation in application.
